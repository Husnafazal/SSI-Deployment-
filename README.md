## Introduction

This project leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of surgical site infections (SSIs) based on patient data and surgical parameters. The goal is to provide healthcare providers with a tool to identify patients at higher risk of developing SSIs.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Husnafazal/SSI-Deployment-.git
   cd surgical-site-infection-project
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:

Open and run copy_of_SSI.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook for detailed steps on model development and evaluation.
(Optional) Retraining the Model:

If you need to retrain the model with new data, update the relevant sections in copy_of_SSI.ipynb and save the updated model.
Model Development and Evaluation
The copy_of_SSI.ipynb notebook documents the process of developing and evaluating the SSI prediction model:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Handle missing data, perform feature engineering, and prepare the dataset for model training.
Model Training: Implement an appropriate machine learning model (e.g., MLPClassifier), train it on the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC AUC. Visualize the results to understand model effectiveness.
Pipeline Creation
The ML pipeline is implemented in Python within src/. Key functionalities include:

preprocessing.py: Functions for data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation.
model.py: Defines and trains the machine learning model.
prediction.py: Contains functions to make predictions using the trained model.
Deployment
The trained model (ssi_model.pkl) can be deployed for predictions:

Local Deployment: Load the model using joblib or pickle in your application.
Cloud Deployment: Deploy the model on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure) for scalability and accessibility.
Optional: Load Testing
If load testing was conducted to assess the model's performance under different request loads, include details and results in this section.
